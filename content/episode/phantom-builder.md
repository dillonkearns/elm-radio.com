## Possible operations with phantom extensible builders

- Add a new field
- Remove a field
- Change the type of a field
- Remove the previously existing phantom type and change it to an empty record (not extensible, just a hardcoded return type) i.e. Replace

## What you can do with phantom builder

- Require something to be always called
- Forbid something being called more than once
- Cause other constraints dynamically after calling something
- Make function calls mutually exclusive
- Enable a function only if another one has been called
