{"text": " Hello Jeroen. Hello Dillon. It's time to take off that face mask, take those cucumbers off your eyes and get out of the spa because we are moving on to Elmland. Oh Elmtown is back but you're going to Elmland? Absolutely and no more cringing at my pronunciation of it because it's just Elmland, simple as that. I mean now you only you always say Elm SPA so I'm good with it. That's fair. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing but if there ever comes a new Elm SPA then I know you'll be good. But now Elmland and we have a nice guest with us. We have Ryan again. Ryan Haswell-Glass, welcome. Hello. How's it going everyone? 1000% renamed the project because spa and SPA. Could not, I didn't know how to resolve that conversation. But yeah, first when you said face mask I was like oh god it's COVID. Like I was so scared. Like what's happening? Am I not in the loop? And then the cucumbers. The cucumbers. That would be a weird combo. Yeah that brought me back. I'm like ah alright I'm getting the visual. This is good. This is definitely better. I was confused until a little bit later. But no it's great to be back. Thanks for having me back on the show. Yeah great to have you Ryan. And well so we're here to talk about Elmland and it is not quite 1.0 but why don't you just tell us like what is the gist of Elmland and you know in a nutshell how does it compare to Elm SPA? Totally. Yeah Elm SPA I mean if people walk away from this and be like oh Elmland's the next Elm SPA I'll be happy with that. Elmland is kind of a I took a step back. I might have brought this up on the previous episode of Elm SPA but when I first got into Elm SPA I really thought I was just going to make an Elm package and that's all that I needed to do. I just wanted to make something to make that boilerplate for like wiring up a browser application easier. And as I started to like get deeper I realized I couldn't get the ergonomics I was looking for without doing a little bit of code gen or generating those basically that case expression in the update or in the view without having the person's custom type in my package there'd be a lot of like pattern matching with underscores at the end. It was kind of a it wasn't a win. So I didn't want to have that. I didn't want to have bugs for people forgetting to wire things up. So Elm SPA was initially just like it kind of brings me back to like the early days when I was learning Elm where we kind of had one tool for everything and that was like I feel like a sense of like we had a sense of pride around that. It was like if you want to use UI we have Elm UI. If you want to use GraphQL, Elm GraphQL. And if you want to do routing, Elm routing, just kidding. Elm SPA because I had to break the pattern there. But no like I feel like I wasn't interested in kind of providing answers for those other areas but as I started to you know talk to more friends about Elm and try to figure out like you know what's what's keeping you from trying it you know where'd you get stuck. I started to realize that the holistic experience of building web apps is tricky and I wanted Elmland to kind of be like hey let's just like handle the whole problem like how do I do this how do I do that. Not necessarily make tools for everything but I wanted Elmland to be able to just focus on like the most critical issue and address that. So that's kind of that's kind of how Elmland spiritually differs I guess from Elm SPA if that makes sense. Right. So yeah philosophically I hear you talking a lot about Evans let's be mainstream talk in this context. I believe that's the inspiration for the rainbow logo. Absolutely. Yeah totally. Yeah that was my first that was my first talk and that was like what got me hooked. So that always gives me a nice warm fuzzy nostalgic feeling. That's awesome. Can you summarize like what were your takeaways from the let's be mainstream talk for anyone who hasn't seen it or doesn't hasn't seen it for a little while maybe. Totally. Yeah my takeaway was so when I watched that the context was I was a JavaScript developer. I was working at a web agency and I was using like react and Vue.js primarily. And when I saw that talk I felt like it was addressed to me and I felt like the gist of the talk was like hey there's this weird thing called functional programming. And if it's the quote he had that really like it hit it was just like if it function if type functional programming is so great outcome no one's using it. And that just like as someone that didn't know it I was really satisfied to hear that. I was like yeah what's up with that. You know what's going on over on the other side. The big takeaway for me was that historically you know these functional languages have been maybe maybe the direction of the marketing wasn't exactly what we wanted but almost designed for like people building front ends. And so when I heard that it was like let's let's make a tool for people building front end UI as opposed to like let's make a nice UI language for functional programmers. And that really like I think helps like guide a lot of the decisions with Elmland which is like yeah like if I have the choice whether to make it like familiar and accessible to a JavaScript developer or make it like the most type safe or the most correct I'll usually lean towards approachable. Normally I don't have to make a trade off because I'm so so nice about that but that's kind of that's why we like it right. Totally totally. But so that's kind of that was my takeaway. It's like what I realized I had been doing for years as like a community member was that telling not showing and I was really being like oh like there's all these guarantees and you know you have all this and you don't like you don't get it. There's you know this is like a whole new level of building things and I wasn't really connecting with some of those core concerns is like I feel like a lot of people do get bought into the vision of Elm but they just have a hard time. How do I use it now. It's like great like this is perfect. This sounds like I don't want to run time exceptions but like how do I use it. And so I really wanted to start shifting to focus on how to answer those questions. Right. I've noticed that the way you talk about it and the way the guide the language of the guide the tone is very focused on the task at hand and not jargon and not like just high level. What are you doing rather than how you're doing it and what language features and immutability and even talking about like custom types and the specifics of how you're doing it. It's more just like hey let's let's add a new URL to our app kind of general language that anyone could understand. So you don't mention monads it and we're in the guide. No no I do that. Yeah I do that never. That's my advice. I still don't. I still feel like after using Elm professionally for like over five years I still don't feel like I have a good grasp on exactly what that word draws a line around. Like I know I'm using them. I know that there's like oh this and that and this and I've heard the rules maybe three or four times and I forget them every time and it's never matter. Sorry sorry functional programmers. I feel like I've got a good grasp of what it means. But then whenever people really use it in a context like oh it's a monadic X or monadic Y. I'm like no you lost me there. Yeah. Oh that's the monadic bind that I'm like yeah you betcha. Yeah. Monadic bind. Yeah. That is like the literal thing what it makes a monad in my opinion or in my understanding at least. But then whenever they use it somewhere else I'm like oh no I don't get it. From what I understand it's like a burrito and I consider myself an expert on burritos. I'm not very good at binding burritos but I know that people do bind burritos so that must be why they're monads. So I feel like the title barista is totally misused on coffee people. That should be on burrito experts. I just. Why don't we have a word for that. And monad experts. Yes. Baristas. So you've talked about this sort of like more holistic vision of making Elmland accessible to people beyond just making a tool making a guide making a community. I think you know you've really explored like that broader vision which is really cool just to like for people who are new to Elmland to bring it back to like what it is exactly. There's still an NPM package at the end of the day just like there's an Elm SPA NPM package. You can NPM install Elmland as well and it gives you something that you can run commands to give you a dev server to add new routes and like the actual tool itself at the core of it is pretty similar to Elm SPA right. Yes that's very true. Yeah the CLI tool it's really just yeah a bit of scaffolding a bit of code gen and then the only difference is that dev server kind of got upgraded from Elm SPA. I think that's like the biggest difference in terms of capability. So when you say that that's or you mean a tool that helps you run it in development. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean this this is a great example of like a difference between Elm SPA and Elmland in terms of philosophy with Elm SPA. I made my server. There was an Elm SPA server command. I was like oh it'll be like Elm Reactor. It's not really you're not supposed to really use it for like you know doing full development because you can't you know with Elm Reactor you can't like import your JavaScript you know web components or anything like that. And with Elmland server I'm like why am I why am I asking people to download this thing and then kind of giving them like half a tool where it's like yeah you can use this until you like really want to use it and then you should go figure out here's like a bunch of examples for how to use something else. Then it goes back to like that core thing. It's like people don't want to pick a dev server. They just want to just want to build something and just the tool should get out of their way. And I always thought it was crazy before my days of Elm the fact that like the front end engineers have to like build their own compilers for like oh this is my SAS pipeline and it's going to go here. And like in the early days it was like Gulp and Webpack and you just write all this code about how to like it's like cut it out. I want to make the button round you know like get out of my face. But yeah. So with Elmland it's there's like there's a little bit of configuration I kind of put in air quotes that don't probably translate over the radio if I don't say that out loud. But the thing with configuration is it's like yeah what link tags do you want to render in the HTML. Do you want the debugger. Yes or no. You know for development for production. But you can just run Elmland server on a new project and you don't have to configure anything special. It'll just work out of the box. Right. And it has a Vite integration built in right. Correct. Yeah it's using Vite under the hood and I don't expose the internals of that. I might have like there's some discussion in the community about you know should we just have that with like a warning. Basically my fear with exposing the internals for the server is that if I you know JavaScript changes so fast if something happens in six months and now everyone's using what's the Vercel one turbo turbo something turbo pack. It's like the whole you know JS ecosystem pivots to using turbo pack for whatever reason. I don't want Elmland developers to have to do that upgrade by hand. I'm like yeah that's something that the framework can handle. You just want a really fast development experience. You want your error messages in the browser. That's a framework problem. That's not a your company problem or your side project problem. So I've done my best to try to hide that it's Vite not like hide and sneak away but not have people bound to that technology the same way that I feel like a lot of frameworks you know before would be like OK like here's your web pack integration or here's your gulp. You know here's where you put your build tool stuff because I've just seen how that changes so fast. Right. So can you if you wanted to use SAS as CSS could can you configure Vite to do that or I guess maybe Vite has that out of the box. I can't remember. I'm not sure. They might have SAS the way that you would do it in Elmland is so there's an example in the repo. I think there's assets and a CSS like folder up on the official repo but the way you do it is you just compile your SAS to CSS using like the SAS package from NPM those CLI tools you just kind of would run concurrently with with the server and then output that in a generated CSS file. But it's not coupled to Vite in any way or coupled to the dev server in the way that we're used to. So they have to do it manually or with their own custom scripts next to Elmland right. Basically yeah. So the example is you run NPM dev and it spins up Elmland server and it spins up SAS watch or whatever it is. SAS watch. SAS. Yes. But that allows you to you know in a few months everyone's doing post CSS for everything everyone's doing tailwind. It's like yeah just plug in whatever you want. The artifact that Elmland cares about is a CSS file. Give me that CSS file. We'll put it in the browser and you're done. Everything else I don't think needs to be conflated but I know I know that's kind of the direction that a lot of the ecosystem is right now. So I'm curious about something now. So you're saying that the main difference between Elmland and Elm SPA is the dev server. So so why didn't you just add a dev server to Elm SPA. I think on the tooling side the big the big upgrade on the CLI side was the dev server. But in terms of like the scope of the project I think Elmland more so differs in like its philosophy and the amount of guides and resources and like I think a big example is like the VS Code plugin. That is not a CLI tool by any means but it's like I watched someone on Twitch try to use Elmland for the first time and it was an early version of Elmland. There were plenty of little bugs that I was taking notes as I watched. And the biggest problem that they ran into is their editor would just kind of be crashing giving them false positives on errors. And I was like this is the number one problem with Elmland is that they can't type. So like whatever it takes to make that holistic experience work that that's kind of what Elmland is. It's not just the not just the CLI tool whereas Elm SPA kind of was. Yeah. So you felt like a rename was probably a good step. Yeah totally just just a step back and maybe it's just because I got the domain. Who knows. But it's definitely a different project in spirit. It feels like. Just to clarify it is Elm.land. Elm.land. Yeah. That is pretty cool. That's pretty sick. Yeah. So are you now president of Elmland or. I am the janitor of Elmland. Okay. CEO janitor. I'm the only employee. I'm literally anything. So I don't know. I do it all. But we do have a dictator. A benevolent dictator for life. Yeah. In charge of one person. Yeah. So I don't know. That's like every political system. You could pick any of them and it would work. Just one guy. It does remind me of something I heard with with Bunn the creator of this Bunn JS runtime was talking about how if like since the goal of Bunn is performance oriented like I guess backward node backwards compatible high performance runtime he was saying that he didn't want anything to be out of scope of what he would tackle if it was on the critical path for improving performance. So if it's right to put it. Yeah. There's some like package he need NPM package he needs to build because that's what's slowing down people's experience executing JavaScript code quickly. Then it's like OK that's in scope. So your attitude here reminds me of that in a similar way where it's just like all right let's look at somebody is maybe somewhat experienced with web development but their interest they're curious about Elm and how can you give them an on ramp that's going to make it as delightful as Elm promises to be holistically as the whole experience of getting started using it. Totally. Totally. Yeah. And there's like so many steps on the way like I when I was first learning it was like finding the right educational like content the right resources and like wrapping my head around the concepts and finding like analogies to what I knew. So like I think there's going to be more development in that space in terms of like what I work on with Elmland is like just providing more concrete resources like look this is a real app. Here's how it works you can play around with it. And yeah yeah it's really about that whole that whole experience just like you said. I really do like I like the like that perspective when you shared with the bun crater. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I've heard people saying really good things about the Elmland guides and I think that's really cool that you're kind of I mean you know as as you run loves to quote the Elm philosophy take responsibility for user experiences. So it is very Elmy to take that ownership and say like it's not enough to say that someone else's problem. Like if it's if they're experiencing that problem using my thing then I'm going to take responsibility for that. That kind of ties into like a feeling that I had early on and I know I've talked to you about this and I've talked to like Matt Griffith about this. But when the community was so small in the beginning there felt like there was a contrast of like stepping on people's toes and like it because it felt emotionally easier to be like oh like I don't want to like mess with UI because that's like you know Matt's domain or I don't want to mess with GraphQL that's Dillon's domain. And so yeah there was like I think there was a hesitation initially. So I definitely I definitely get why that hasn't happened historically in the Elm community because everyone's so friendly and everyone's so close that no one wants to really be like hey don't use this use this you know and no one wants to be competitive internally. So yeah I think that was probably the biggest like emotional hurdle for trying to like make a framework that encapsulated so many different aspects of building web apps. I'm like am I going to be stepping on the toes of the people that like helped me get here. You know what I mean. That was like a freaky. That was a freaky thing. And in talking to you and talking to Matt you guys were both like no don't worry about it. Like what. Yeah great stuff. We want great stuff. Totally totally. I totally understand that. Yeah it is true that when people say oh I want to make this tool for doing GraphQL and like well there's Elm GraphQL that Dillon made and like yeah but I still want to do like my own thing or like there's something that Elm GraphQL doesn't support or something like that. The best solution is usually like go talk to the author and see if you can do if you can improve their solution because that leaves less choices to the user like which GraphQL package do you want to use. Well this if there's one and it's great then that's the best experience that a user can could ask for. If there's like five and they're all like well in this case in your situation you might want to use this one or this one or these three other ones then that's not as great. So there's this advice which I tend to give and I still tend to give but I totally understand that also prohibits people from doing something because yeah you're going to need to do something new in some cases like with Elmland. That reminds me of that reminds me of the coolest. Hey coolest is extreme. The coolest thing I ever heard in a tech talk from the Elm community was Richard Feldman gave a talk about Elm UI and Richard Feldman most I'm sure everyone on this podcast knows and if not don't feel bad sorry but Richard Feldman is like he made Elm CSS which was like in my opinion like the de facto way to do CSS before Elm UI came out. It was you know there was no alternative besides just not writing not writing it at all. And the cool thing that he did was in his talk he was like yeah I made an alternative to this but like use use this guys use Elm UI. I was like that was so cool because it gave us the benefit of like yeah if you're like new to the community everyone regardless of who made what is like advocating for you know the whatever the best tool at the moment is or whatever the most likely to be successful tool is. But it's still allowed like Matt to create Elm UI which like if you tried to this is maybe a silly example but like if he tried to coordinate with Richard Feldman it's like hey I think you know like we really want one way to do UIs maybe Elm CSS should look like this instead. I think that would have been like slower for him and so I'm kind of glad that he went and said like no I don't in order to like experiment or explore I don't need to really necessarily coordinate with Richard Feldman in terms of like the projects like vision you know what I mean. Does that make sense or is it kind of a yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. In this example the vision of Elm CSS and of Elm UI are different. So if the vision is different then you don't want to pursue the same path. You don't want to have one project or at least if they're two different. Totally. Yeah they're similar enough. I think it's great to collaborate. So was there like other projects which you thought ElmLens visions conflicted with or coincided with. I don't think it conflicted with anything. I mean the only similar tool in the space is Elm Pages and at the time I mean before the v3 update there really wasn't too much overlap in terms of use cases. Now the v3 is more like dynamic and it's kind of more like remix like style. There's definitely overlap there. But I don't know I don't I don't see like I guess Dillon and I will talk about like hey like this API is what I'm thinking about and we like share share ideas and ideas from I know like Dillon's error messages for example from Elm Pages v2. That was something that inspired ElmLand. And was it the shared model or what was the thing that was borrowed from Elm SPA was the shared. I definitely definitely yeah borrowed shared you know you doing the file based routing definitely gave me the confidence to be like oh yeah I guess I guess that would work OK and like because at first I was like all these JS tools that do it have much more flexible file naming patterns that you can use whereas with Elm like you can only has to start with a capital letter and the only special character you can use is underscore but but not at the beginning for some reason. Yeah exactly. Yeah totally yeah. Yeah. I feel like I feel like that's an example of like two explorations that strengthened each other as they grew because I mean the culture the culture within the Elm community has never felt to me like you know X versus Y. Yeah for me the biggest like responsibility that that I've felt and we've discussed this together is just like how do we explain to people how to navigate these choices like how do we help them understand what the trade offs are so that they know going into it how to how to make a good choice. And I think that's like because I don't know I mean I think we're just trying we're all just trying to improve the Elm community and strengthen that and having different having different perspectives out there different you know tools that have a different approach or that solve different you know maybe slightly different maybe overlapping problems but slightly different. There's a lot of value to that and the innovation in itself is really valuable too. So even if something is overlapping a little bit but it's innovating I mean it can get to the whole JavaScript fatigue level and that's you know that's not ideal but I definitely don't think we're there and I think there's value to the experimentation too. So is Elmland if somebody is starting a new project right now should they use Elmland or Elm SPA? Elmland even though it doesn't have that 1.0 version we have now surpassed the functionality as well as the I think the quality of Elm SPA. On August 12th I know this podcast is going to be recorded or posted a little in the future so I'll try to be specific but on August 12th I released a live stream video on my YouTube of you know upgrading Elm SPA from scratch. Yerun was hanging out in the chat I think Yerun's the first chatter you'll see if you watch that but it took about you know an hour and hour 15 I'd say to migrate the real world Conduit app over and it was mostly half of that was me just joking around and chatting with people so sorry if you have to watch all that it's it come join the Twitch stream it's more fun that way but yeah I upgraded the real world app and it was really just it always comes back to the same thing Evan did such great work with the Elm compiler I just get to piggyback off of that awesome user experience so if you have an Elm SPA project and you want to like upgrade it like the Elm compiler will literally just tell you everything you will in that stream you will watch me use about 2% of my brain and hopefully the Elmland guide will cover the rest of like what does this error mean kind of stuff. So if you thought that Ryan was smart he's actually 50 times smarter than that. Yeah no I think that what people should know about me is that I choose Elm because I want to be dumb you know I don't I don't like I don't want to be fancy at work I don't want to be clever I just I want to just do it the dumbest way possible and that just works and it's reliable and it doesn't keep me up at night so Elm matches my personality I would say. Yeah I would say I like to be smart I like to feel smart but I don't like having to be smart in order to program. Fair enough I think it's hilarious to say I'm stupid I think that's just like a funny sentence and fun to say so like if you just say that a few times it's like all of a sudden starts to grow on you it's like I'm an idiot you know it feels good. And that's one of those sentences where the more you say it the more people will believe you. I hope so. Cool. Only a fool would think that they're smart though let's be honest. Yeah there's a name for that thing but I don't remember it. So you said that if someone went to start with building a new Elm application you would probably recommend Elmland or at least if they considered Elm SPA. Do you think that Elmland is also at a point where if you just if you're new to Elm you should start with Elmland or should they go through the Elm guide first? I think if you're like me and you you learn with like examples I think Elmland is a great place to start just so that you can it depends where you're coming from. So Elmland was designed for for folks working with React or Vue who are familiar with you know frameworks like Next.js or you know SvelteKit or whatever that just lets them just like add a page add a button that kind of stuff. Definitely the Elm guide is like a resource that you should check out but when it comes to getting a feeling for the language and like experiencing the compiler I think leading with syntax especially in Elm can be harmful because it gives the wrong idea. I think we kind of have a culture of like hello world like when you're looking at the examples how many lines of code is it how weird do the letters look and it doesn't really capture the feeling of oh I like change this and I got a really nice error message. So I personally think that starting with examples whether that's Elmland or you know another framework I think starting with the framework is a really good way to get a honest view of what it would be like to work with the tool as opposed to comparing kind of snippets and learning like like whoa they use plus plus instead of plus like I'm out of here like what is this. It's like that's not what you're going to hate in a year. Yeah that's actually true like the Elm guide is amazing but one of the other amazing things with Elm is the compiler error messages and I don't think the guide mentions it much or nearly enough like just the fact that you should rely on the compiler error messages and that this is just great part of Elm. I don't think it does put enough emphasis on it. Yeah it's hard because it's like a you know a Gitbook and it's really the goal of that document is like how does the language work at a fundamental level. I mean that's that actually really does resonate what you just said with me because when I was reading the Elm guide I was I was I was I had like one foot out the door. I remember looking at the syntax being like this is weird. I don't think even if I could figure it out if this is something that I'd want my coworkers to be exposed to and then it wasn't until I saw that button example like the counter you know plus minus and there was a challenge at the end of the guide section was like hey add reset. It wasn't until I did that that I experienced the compiler and I'm like oh like this is nuts. I just typed in like some weird alien language and I just added a feature and it was right on the first guess with no help and I'm like whoa. And it circles back to I'm not smart like I'm telling you guys this is something you could do with no experience and the compiler does guide you. I think yeah I think a lot of people when they see people that can use these tools the assumption is oh they must be different than me they must be able to do something. It's like no. I was a Vue.js developer like we're all on the same team here. I didn't know you really have to believe Ryan he's really not that's not so dumb. You guys someone tell me. I'll just you have to ask my coworkers. Is there anything else on your radar. We talked about like that this idea that nothing is out of scope for trying to like give this easy on ramp for helping people get acclimated to Elm with this goal of let's be mainstream. Like what other points of friction do you see for users with their on ramp to Elm right now. Some of which you might have solved already and some of them you haven't. Yeah. Of the things I haven't solved. So I set out with that like initial like Elm land you know hello world post or whatever I set out for the goal of like you should be able to build GitHub with Elm and every you know the framework should be able to handle an app with that level of complexity and without without setting like that concrete goal I wouldn't have catch all routes right because you can't have GitHub without that file explorer page where you don't know the depth of the users you know get repo you don't know if it's source CLI read me or if it's you know read me dot basically like the depth of the URLs. So catch all routes was something that was added. But in terms of things that are still missing like if I wanted to make it up there's two big things that are missing one you could get around by using you know some type of I don't know like serverless function or something which is like meta tags for GitHub when you share a repo you want to see a nice preview of that image you want to see you know you shared on discord shared on Twitter you need to have meta tags at server render time for those those meta tag crawlers to work and that's not something that Elm land supports that's not something in the near term that I think about adding but it would be nice to have an example of how to do that you know maybe with for sale or with Netlify like hey if I wanted to do meta tags if someone had I think it was someone at Elm camp that was I was like yeah I don't use Elm land for anything that needs meta tags and they were just like can I just do that function I was like oh yeah I guess yeah thanks so that makes sense the other thing is initially I was thinking about a UI plug-in and a graph QL plug-in I've since backed off of the UI angle I think making a UI frameworks really hard yeah there's like ideas I had an experiment that actually is public if anyone wants to play around with it this is not Elm land related this is at Ryan NHG slash CSS dash in dash Elm CSS and Elm and what it does is I just write my CSS file and I use this like you know 2 million plus NPM download package that Svelte uses to just scan the AST grab the class names and just generate me a file called CSS so I can just say CSS dot row that goes so far I've been building out like a product with this just like you know playing around with it and it's insane you can delete a CSS class and get an Elm error message you don't make typos in Elm it's like you can use Elm review to figure out unused CSS in your dot CSS file all with the ergonomic benefits of just typing CSS and like getting the auto complete from your editor and all that I was that was like 40 lines of code and I just published it so that people could could try it out and it's not it's like not perfect there's like little like bugs that I work around because I don't care about it being right I just I'm using it and it's great but I don't want to make a UI package for Elm land I think Elm UI 2 might be on the horizon I don't know the timeline is for that I want to hold anyone anything but I've heard rumors that that might be a thing and then GraphQL when I was working at vendor I kind of started that I kind of started the GraphQL project a little bit but then with like resourcing and stuff Matt Griffith was able to take that and take push over the line there were some ideas that I wanted to explore with GraphQL that I think would be really great and most importantly I want to have a really good documentation experience for people working with GraphQL so if you're making a GitHub app you're going to want to use the GraphQL API so that's actually something I've been working on in the past like within the past week I was just kind of tinkering around with that and seeing where that goes but yeah I think GraphQL meta tags those are the biggest limitations right now and when it comes to building real things but I think they have a future for Elm land for me is building stuff and finding those gaps that's been really satisfying I love to start new projects and I love to like deploy things and share cool cool screenshots and gifts so I think I'll continue to do that and then that'll reveal more more holes in the framework but yeah that's cool so it sounds like maybe like the guides fill a big part of that gap for you of making the onboarding experience easier absolutely yeah I think there's a lot of stuff where it's like it's doable now but it's not clear how to get there and so like there's some things where it's like yeah I don't even have to implement a feature I just have to explain a concept components the component section of the guide is something that it took me years to really find a pattern that I was happy with when it came to like advanced you know components that needed to not only keep their own state but also you know bubble up events to the to the parent and so I think the components section in the online guide is like one of my favorites because I feel like I could finally share that share that that problem I had for years solution to that with people what are some of the highlights of the component section of the guide yeah highlights is you know using using the simplest component possible so it starts by just introducing you to like if you want to make a footer and it doesn't have any interactivity just make a function called footer and put some markup in there and if you want to make something that's highly configurable I recommend using Brian Brian Hicks had that robot button from Mars pattern so if you just find yourself trying to do the first thing where you're just making a function but you have all these optional arguments that you don't want to specify explicitly every time use that builder pattern very useful and then yeah when it gets in the stateful the there's it's I think it's called like the one two threes of elm components or whatever in the guide that third level is the really interesting one which like answer the question that I had which is how do I keep state private how do I guarantee that like my drop downs closing itself and you know when I search it's managing that that search string but I'm not making the the call or wire that up every time and so a lot of that is optimizing for making the component easy to call at the cost of making the update function do the you know do the HTML mapping and all that kind of stuff for you doing doing them the mapping internally so so is this more of a tutorial or a really a guide or does element also do something special with those components it is just a just a guide or a tutorial and it's in the concept section if you go to elm elm dot land slash guide it's just kind of introducing you to components in general but kind of putting in context of the elm framework or sorry the elm land framework where we have a fact dot send message which is kind of a core core feature of bubbling up events and things like that but you could use this in a vanilla elm app you could use this in elm pages the technique totally stands for anyone who has an existing on project today and it's what we've adopted we adopted at vendor and we are not using elm land you know at vendor yeah I recognize a lot of patterns that we use at work as well so definitely good things in here someone tweeted something that really warmed my heart the other day it was something like this like oh I just wish I knew about this elm land framework it's like all the things we use at work that it's like public now or whatever I forget the exact wording but it was cool to like to feel validated by it's like yeah if you made a bunch of people figure it out on their own and no one coordinated they'd all arrive at that solution it's a concurrent evolution yeah I think the point that he was trying to make was something like I spent years coming out arriving at the same solution so if elm land was here today or back when I started then I would have jumped a few years already yeah hopefully that's what we're that's what we do we can you know achieve as a community it's like just building those foundations so people the next wave of elm developers starts a little bit higher up the rung than we did mm-hmm yeah I mean when I started the question was like how do you do an elm SPA yeah right and now we're we're past that it's like how don't you do an elm SPA how do you do a single page app which with literally one page place great I tried I tried making one page but I had to make two like what the hell it was very difficult figuring out in those early like the early elm 19 days figuring out how do you build an SPA I mean because you we really do rely on these patterns and examples and you know once you've done it you you know what to look for so you can you know plunk it out but but yeah I mean like how do you approach components how do you build an SPA you know in the case of elm land it takes care of the routing for an SPA and all the wiring so that's even better you don't even have to think about it which really is I think as it should be like it just I don't see any value in manually doing that wiring yourself personally I think I think that's well done as a solved problem but um but there are many things in elm where it is sort of like elm is such a simple language that it's just like there are these patterns and this is the natural way to do it but it's hard to figure out those patterns on your own so a little guidance goes a long way for things like how do I do a component and and in this guide you're choosing to use these terms I think that someone from a JS background would be more comfortable with even though it is sort of frowned upon to talk about it like a component in elm because it's like well components are object-oriented things that hide state and we don't do that in elm yeah I I had like an elm SPA component guy that was with that energy was like well we don't really do it that that's not the elm way that's the JavaScript way and we do it this way and then I joined vendor and that's I shared this with Matt Griffith and he's like well then how do you do this and I'm like well well it's I guess I don't do that then because I can't with that limited you know I was so now I kind of embrace like no it's fine we'll do it that way because that's I don't know how else to do it good you know so it's okay to very rarely I will create a stateful component like that but when I need it it's great to know how to do it I think that's probably the biggest difference with JS it's like everything is is that by default one thing I really liked with elm SPA so Dillon talked about that it does all the wiring for you handle all the boilerplate or a bunch of boilerplate one thing I really liked with elm SPA is that that boilerplate was made using code gen and that you could actually just find that boilerplate you could because it was in your dot elm SPA folder or something and if you were wondering like where is this page used or how is elm SPA using it in this boilerplate that I don't know well you can look at it and the magic would vanish it's like oh it's just it's just that simple do you still have that in elmland yeah still look great yeah absolutely yeah so now there's a big changes instead of an elm SPA folder I've moved it to an elm land folder and oh my god so sorry I will say the biggest difference in terms of the generated code is two big differences I'll call out one elm land doesn't use a package elm SPA did so there was some portion of the elm SPA generated code that was kind of behind an elm SPA package with elm land it's just using URL it's just using like all the all the native kind of elm modules that people are used to so there's no like other thing to look at and there's no confusion when I talk about you know installing elm land it's like no not the package you can't find it so if you if you go to the elm packages thing and you search for elm land I didn't make one someone could please don't it'll confuse people I was thinking of doing it right now no I did not do this there will be a for this episode there'll be a your own elm land with a reading that says got him but no the that's one big difference and the other difference is with elm SPA when I couldn't figure out how to solve a problem I would just make main elm customizable and what that did was it allowed people to like you know they weren't limited by the framework and I felt like I would get you know pinged less or whatever but with elm land I'm really doing my best to be like if you have a problem everyone's gonna have that problem how do we solve it in the framework in a way where I'm not putting the cost on each individual company or each individual user using the project so main is no longer customizable in that same way but now because of that trade-off now pages and layouts they have access to these hooks they have URL change hooks which in most cases were more ergonomically beneficial and was one of the requested features for elm SPA so by constraining you know the ability to customize main all of a sudden oops it's just a better experience out of the box for everyone and more features that are helpful so you can't eject out of some parts of well and elm SPA I guess that's because you could configure your view or you can configure your main or you can configure some things right but now yeah with elm land the only difference is the main file is not ejectable but view is ejectable effect shared everything that you you needed to have access to before the 404 page all those are still ejectable totally customizable except for main main was my name was just like I don't know guys here you go you know please don't don't yell at me on slack that was just like a I don't know what the word is can you also define your own index that HTML or something so you do but rather than specifying at as HTML you're gonna specify what tags you want in your elm land JSON file and the reason for that is if you have control over the HTML file you are coupled to beat if you're using a certain module import for example that works in beat I didn't want anyone to get coupled to the framework so what I did was I exposed those link tags those script tags those meta tags as data that can be specified in a data format and then I can translate that into whatever you know dev server we're we're using in six months a huge example of when this can be beneficial I need to coordinate with Simon Lydell about this you had a you had a elm radio episode with him about elm watch that tool is amazing I want that in elm land I think it's like the best elm hot reloading experience I've ever seen with this approach without being able to customize the HTML file I can upgrade everyone to use elm watch for the elm files and they can continue to use beat for their you know npm packages and all that stuff but the but the core could be using that yeah when you said you're defying your own dev server I was like oh then you can't use elm watch exactly awesome the trick is we need to you know figure out this there's some it's like oh I like parcel better like feet better but at the end of the day it's like performance when you save the file that's another huge thing I need to work on at the elm land performance when you when you're generating the code but we just want the best thing it doesn't matter like if people want to argue tabs versus spaces or you know indent two versus four or like beat versus parcel I'm like that's great for the elm community if you want that's not great for elm land elm land is like I want to make a button it's got to be red I'm talking like real red and you got to be able to click it and make dollars we're not going to worry about the those little those little debates within within the framework so you don't define your index at html but you define it in some other way and you can also define your own ports or define your own web components if you wanted to exactly yep and I think it takes an approach similar to I think Dillon did this in elm pages where rather than have a html file we're importing like the elm and doing elm main init it's just a file where you can say hey this is where my flags are gonna go this is where my this is a function I call when my elm app is ready and they have access to environment variables and they have access to the app that that second function has access to the app where you can access the ports and all that kind of stuff I really like that approach and that does keep it agnostic of the framework or the dev server yeah no it's it's really interesting to hear how your thinking has evolved with the customizing main because in our elm spa episode that we had with you a while back you talked about not wanting to have users blocked on something you didn't think of and I mean I thought that was a really cool insight in in general this idea that like you know let's not make users too dependent on me thinking of every single way they could possibly build an app but I think you've maybe still kept that thinking that you you don't want users to be limited by your imagination but maybe by providing some hooks and extension points you can give them all the tools they need to do that in a more cleanly packaged way that isn't as much of a sharp knife totally I think the I think the big thing is that's easy for me to make a main customizable but what's really cool in terms of like a social like structure is if I don't make it customizable I get bug reports and I actually get feedback so maybe it's a little bit messed up but that's how I get I can get you know hey this how do I do this and I'm like great if you could customize main you never would have told me that you couldn't do this and then you'd come in you'd do it you'd have a bad time and that would be a secret thing that happened at your company that you'd be suffering with for months and I'd be like if you just told me I could have flipped this switch you know let me know about it you know yeah and then you could come up with the best solution for everyone and now no one will have that problem anymore I think a great example is something that I didn't do is like the a lot of people want to use tailwind CSS and they're like how do I use that the in the online discord there's a community member Dazoni who just like made a made a plugin it's just so cool when just having a place where people are like I just want to build it with this how do I do it and I can like link to someone's repo I feel like there's a huge weight off my shoulders and people are like working together and that's like a space where yeah no one's like everyone's like collaborating and I want to see more of that I want to see more people joining that community and feeling empowered to make suggestions and even like code changes to the the framework I don't want to be like the bottleneck in terms of feature development so I try to encourage people when they do suggest a feature I'm like that's a great idea and I would I'd love to review that here's here's what I would need like if you just add this example or you know show what you want we have a really cool test suite this is a bit of a tangent where it's not unit tests it's not elm tests it is it's called bats and it's bash automated testing something I don't think that's something but it's something else that starts with s and all I do is I just have like tests that are like run elm land expect the output says welcome to elm land run elm land add page blah blah blah you expect an error message it says hey specify a valid url it's really nice and so with all these examples in the official repo I just have run elm land build in that folder and that's a part of my automated testing so it'll catch if I add a feature that breaks interop you know as long as there's an example that perfect pretends prevents regressions and the cost of adding a test is adding an example which is also beneficial because then people have something to click through and run on their computer that is the most happy I've been with tests in my entire life I feel like I'm not a very good TDD person so like I never really know how to start or how to but those are like the most payout out of any test I've ever written I'm sure Dillon is like super proud of you yeah no that's amazing it does sound great yeah and enters are huge I would like to have actually more of this kind of fully end-to-end tests where it's actually like running the CLI for for elm pages I do have a lot of Cypress tests where it's actually spinning up a browser and running through examples and executing back-end tasks and running tests against them and I mean it's it's very easy to write you know you just like expect this text to exist in the browser and you know it's like it's it's not rocket science but it gives you a lot of confidence that it's actually doing this thing it's actually printing this error message when you go to this route or if you if you remove a route the 404 page in the dev server correctly guides the user on how to add a new page or whatever you want to do you know so yeah that's huge it's huge for contributors yeah yeah I think it's great because it's like the most important thing to me is that the promises that I make on the guides are kept and so I love that the tests that cover my cover my butt when uh when there's a breaking change so like I that's that's been great yeah and and I mean talking about like creating a delightful on-ramp for for users right I mean if it's if it's janky if it's glitchy it's not gonna be super delightful and at the end of the day we're we're stupid right that's we're all self-admitted idiots so yeah except for you and he's like no stop calling that you guys that fool how could he how could he not think he's stupid but uh Dillon and I are stupid yeah definitely we're very stupid I'm okay you're in the middle of the road you mean I stand in the middle of the road I don't know I don't think that would be very middle of the road of you but yeah if you're if you're stupid then you'd better write some tests to make sure when you make a mistake it catches it because you will make a mistake because you're stupid right so I wouldn't love the um compiler so much if I wasn't if I was able to like remember everything about everything all the time you know like there's a certain like implicit like you know why you're here because you know you make typo and typo make bug exactly elm is not a very good language if you are a perfect genius who never makes any mistakes then yeah use assembly like get out of here imagine the imagine the elm compiler remembered all of your mistakes and reminded you of past mistakes when you make errors like oh again made this typo again yeah I want that you know you sorry go ahead do you know you've made this mistake like 432 times now that would be awesome another type mismatch come on I think what we should actually add to the elm compiler is uh sometimes I make a typo that's a funny word it should chuckle it should like ha you accidentally type like fart or something you know it's like I think you meant to type first but that's hilarious bro I think you should have a sense of humor the dictionary I often write uh list dot fitler oh yeah I do that too yeah I typed something live on stream it was horrible oh I I mistyped flags and I'll just I'll stop there I like screened oh and I just like immediately deleted it I was like I'm gonna get my VOD taken down I'll get canceled it's horrible I had a heart attack but we should change that for your name you do not deserve that rainbow logo that's true yeah yeah so earlier you mentioned someone made a tillwind plugin they made a example repo uh they didn't make anything too fancy or too specific to the framework but um yeah they basically made a resource for people to use they click on it and then this is like a just like the examples in the folder I think at some point I need to work that into the official repo but I haven't had a chance to run it and play around with the experience to make it like official yet but it's people have been using it and it's been really nice um allegedly from those people I haven't I uh as as I told you I'm writing raw CSS and doing weird things that's cool how do you think about that community so you have you have an elmland discord we'll drop a link in the show notes to that tell us a little bit about the discord and the community and and how you kind of think about building that community totally yeah I think so since we already have the elm slack it didn't really make sense for me to have a separate space with the same goals it's just like hey what if we had a smaller pool of the existing developers something I noticed on the elm slack is that there is a big variety of of different folks on there there are people that are excited about uh functional programming like language syntax there's people that want to you know uh make cool packages and then there's you know there's some people that want to like build apps and and get unblocked and do stuff like that so the goal with the elmland community was to be able to set a tone of you know if you join this discord if you know whether you're coming from react or view or angular we don't x versus y here we're never gonna make a a subtle joke about you know oh like this wow let's look at this new react library this is pretty bad or something like we're not gonna do that kind of stuff what you come to the elmland discord for is hey I've got this cool project I want to share it with people that are enthusiastic about you know using elm to build things I'm looking at the I'm looking at the discord itself on the right here but like I have a question right I'm a beginner I tripped up on got this error message so it's really like a practical like troubleshooting as well as kind of celebrating like real real work but there's no like channel for like you know argue about oh camel versus you know haskell syntax and I kind of joke about that but like no moral judgment on that at all it's just like that's not what I wanted this space to be it's just uh it's off topic I guess is the way to think about it but yeah I mean uh what's come out of that so far is like my favorite thing about elm favorite thing to see online is when people share like things they built whether that's like a 3d car or like a website or an app or like a I saw someone make like a midi app one time I wanted to create a space where people you know if they weren't on twitter and they didn't feel comfortable doing that publicly they had like a safe space where they could drop their project and we could all just spam it with hard emojis and elm land rainbows and just have that kind of energy there so there's been some really really cool projects that have come out of that and that's I'll post my projects in there too so it's not just asking people to do it I'll do it too but yeah I love that I mean I think you know like in in an elm spa or elm land slack channel I mean I think you're gonna tend to feel a little more constrained if you want to just spam with a cool project you're working on as you're giving updates on like oh this little thing because it's like one channel and then somebody else is like asking a beginner's question or somebody else is like trying to coordinate on like hey I want to add this feature how can I contribute you know so it just opens up a little more space to give people the the sense of comfort to just stretch out and do different things there in this space and really build a community so I think I think that's a great idea to build a little discord community sweet yeah I mean incremental elms out there I remember that too and it is cool you have channels for different topics and you can kind of mute what you don't want to talk about and it's a good vibe yeah which ones do you mute we're gonna judge you now I'm gonna pull it open and see what I got muted do I have anything muted I don't have anything muted I was too excited what a nerd anything muted do I no for anybody who doesn't know incremental elm is a is a discord we have for contributing to the elm ecosystem so it's completely focused on rolling up your sleeves and building things or giving feedback less focused on the sort of slack what slack excels at giving help for for user questions and things like that so yeah that's been a really cool space for us to cheer each other on as we're kind of building fun projects yeah it's cool to see like all these channels like cogen and like a forum and like all these different threats where it's like yeah if you want to contribute to the ecosystem you've kind of got like a channel for everything here which is great yeah I'm a big fan of these little communities with a very clear purpose and I think I think communities thrive when there's kind of a clear theme to it all so we talked about elm land 1.0 and is it basically is the headline for 1.0 that it will come when you can successfully recreate github with elm land yeah I don't know if if I'm gonna wait until like like an actual github clone is is out or like a you know like a basic github clone is out that might that might be what stops the 1.0 release that might be like a satisfying way to go but I really think it's it's about those features that I would need to make that possible let me see if I've got it here yeah so like performance improvements is big I think elm watch is a must it's it's like very very high very high up maybe not a must necessarily because you still have a dev server but I think there's a big room for improvement there's some missing guide sections for some reason I just forgot about the interop section and the environment variables for anyone listening right now like today you can make a dot env file and it just works it's very good but I didn't write I didn't put no one I told nobody so that's kind of stupid so I got to put that in the guide hard dogs are so hard I admire you for putting so much love into these docs because it really is extremely hard yeah it's been the most time-consuming part of the project though as they say the code is the easy part and it's really just been yeah a lot of docs work I want to have like a clear answer to testing I want to like figure out what's the easiest way like I've got elm review on here like the things like that where it's like what's the like the normal de facto way to build an app and GraphQL is I need to have an answer for it not necessarily a library I'd like to make an onland GraphQL plugin but it does as long as I can point people in the direction of like hey here's how you write GraphQL code and and make queries without having to write those decoders by hand I think that's good and then beyond 1.0 I think it's just more more examples and more interactive videos or more educational videos sorry it kind of feels like minor improvements or not major improvements so it feels like you're almost there yeah it really is it's a lot of minor stuff this last released 0.19 weirdly intersecting with elms current version that was like the big that was the big thing where it was like I'm finally past elm SPA it's finally like I've got those framework errors and you know it's it's ready for people to upgrade to and yeah it was such a weight off my shoulders when I when I finally released that so that was huge but yeah it's much a minor stuff but it's like the little stuff that I think is really important it's like the remaining the remaining bit but yeah yeah if you want to help contribute to that hop in discord and help me please we're almost there then we can be big and exciting 1.0 people that's so cool yeah I mean it sounds like you know I mean if I were if I were to guess before we had this conversation what 1.0 would involve I would guess like parody with elm SPA and and stability and and not expecting any like major breaking changes for the sort of core functionality but it sounds like that sort of 1.0 vibe is is kind of there at this point and you're like let's be ambitious let's have 1.0 be like the guides are something I can fully get behind and say I didn't miss any pages I you know people aren't tripping up on anything and we've built like a holistic onboarding experience that's going to be really positive for people who are new to elm for me 0.19 just means 1.0 so yeah right I think you're there our brain translates it yeah well then I'll 2.0 to your own and 1.0 to the world I'll probably I'll probably have a 20 in there before I have a 1.0 but we'll see but yeah no I'm excited because I for a while I was streaming and then I was kind of streaming elm land development and that's fine but like I'm excited about now that elm lands done getting to make goofy things I was on the house on the way to lunch with my fiance or sorry not lunch I was I was going for a walk with her this morning I was talking about you know what I want to make I want to make a pet only Instagram you know you know just a bit goofy or it's just like you can only have dogs and cats and they're just like doing stuff they're even doing like influencer things you know like product placement but like only pets or something I don't know I'm afraid of it and I'm not buying any domain so it'd probably be only pets that elm.land oh that might have bad connotation so we'll think about the name we'll workshop that you know like a mobile friendly dark mode that movies app that I just released last week is like I really I really enjoyed that that was like a dark mode using a real rest API type thing I want to I want to do more projects like that where people can just like have fun using it you know they don't you don't have to dive in the code you can just be dazzled that's fine yeah yeah at the end of the day we're trying to build cool stuff not build cool stuff to let you build cool stuff yeah yeah although we spend a lot of time doing that the three of us I'd say someone's got to do it you know and it's all right to do and once it's done though you got to remember what our goal was in the beginning right exactly yeah well amazing what should people look to to follow you for for future updates and to keep an eye on elm land and what's going on there for sure yeah yeah if you want to keep an eye on elm land if you go to join dot elm dot land that's that'll take you straight to the discord I'm very cool subdomains I figured it out but yeah so elm dot land is the website and then if you want to follow me on twitter I'm just at rhg underscore dev I'll post when I go live on twitch on youtube if I have like youtube videos or whatever but yeah the discord is a great place to see what the community is building so I definitely if you only went to one of those links I would definitely recommend checking out the discord or following following on twitter I guess if you're not a discord user yeah amazing yeah and then I do have a github sponsors page for anyone that's interested in like supporting the project you can go to l-9's website there's a sponsors section at the bottom and you can just click sponsor and it'll take you to my face but yeah that would that that'd be great there's just a few sponsors and they're already and it's just it's such a satisfying feeling to know that like people are benefiting from it that they're excited to to say thanks in that way and every dollar means I can like spend a little bit more time on it it'll be really cool to be able to focus on this full time because there's a lot of marketing work that would need to go into this before you know before we see that that mainstream traction that I think everyone's hoping for yeah it's a great way to contribute back if you if you enjoy the project well amazing stuff thanks so much Ryan for for coming on and sharing all these thoughts with us it was really lovely having you back on yeah for sure thanks for having me and Jeroen until next time until next time",
