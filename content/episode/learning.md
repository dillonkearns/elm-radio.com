## Ideas for Effective Learning

- Have a playground to try out ideas
- Try a new tool or technique with a familiar problem or exercise
- Small scale exercises and real world projects
- Small scale exercises are helpful for quickly developing a skill
- Feedback loops
- Tiny steps shorten the feedback loop
- Use [code katas](https://codingdojo.org/kata/) like bowling, tennis, roman numeral katas
- Analogous to empirical scientific method (hypothesis, test, analyze)
- Call your shot
- Don't forget to analyze test results after
- Listen to smart people, but come to your own conclusions
- Try two alternate ways of doing something out for yourself
- Failure is part of learning
- Follow your curiosity
- Look at the source for projects you depend on or come across
- [Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/)
- You have to make knowledge your own (synthesis) - connect it to what you know
- Just in time vs. just in case learning - focus on what you need or seems important now
