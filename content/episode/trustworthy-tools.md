- Error messages should give three pieces of info
  - The problem
  - Why it's a problem
  - How to go forward
- Needing to do magic incantations to get things into a good state adds cognitive load and makes debugging harder
- Make tools more predictable
  - Clear mental model (avoid inconsistencies and leaky abstractions)
  - Doing an operation through different means should consistently arrive at the same result
  - Give context
  - Avoid caveats
